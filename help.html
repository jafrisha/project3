<p style= "font-size: 20px; background-color: lightblue;"><b>1) How does the volunteering program work? <br> <br>
  The program is focused on helping disabled and senior residents of the local community who require assistance clearing snow, which may include stairways, sidewalks, and driveways. Some may request to have their cars cleared of snow. <br> <br>
  Throughout the winter season, the administrators of this website will actively monitor weather forecasts for any potentially hazardous wintry precipitation. As a rough guideline, when at least 2 inches of snow accumulations are expected, volunteers will receive notifications by email and text message alerting them to begin preparations for the weather. Once snowfall starts, volunteers electronically receive the address(es) where they are needed. Volunteers should arrive within 12 to 24 hours after snowfall has ended. <br> <br>
  2) How far will volunteers need to travel? <br> <br>
  Please be prepared to travel up to 20 miles one-way. Volunteers are randomly assigned to addresses within the same county, sometimes near one another, sometimes farther apart. Volunteers must take every precaution necessary for traveling in winter weather, and only travel as long as there no restrictions placed on motorists. Volunteers are expected to have access to safe, reliable vehicles in order to participate in the program. <br> <br>
  3) What supplies are needed? <br> <br>
  Volunteers must arrive with their own supplies and tools, but are free to use plastic snow shovels, snow blowers, or other tools of their choice. Care must be exercised to avoid damaging property while clearing snow by any given means. Once snow is cleared, a light coating of rock salt should be sprinkled on surfaces to avoid developing icy spots. <br> <br>
  4) How much time should volunteers devote? <br> <br>
  The maximum time a volunteer should spend at one address is 2 hours. Volunteers will already have been provided with a set of instructions written by the resident that will direct them where to clean. Upon arrival, the resident may also communicate any additional instructions. Volunteers can sign up to complete either one or two jobs in a single day, and can also choose to be called on 2 or more consecutive days, depending on the amount of snowfall received. <br> <br>
  5) Will volunteers receive training? <br> <br>
  All new volunteers will participate in a brief orientation via a one-on-one video call. Additionally, volunteers will receive training by viewing a specially prepared 15-minute online video presenation.
